#+title: poudriere-custom-packages

Simple [[https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/][Jenkinsfile]] with a package list of packages for [[https://github.com/freebsd/poudriere/wiki][poudriere]] to build.
** Files
~Jenkinsfile~ is a Jenkins pipeline script for running poudriere.
~packages.list~ is a list of packages for poudriere to build.
** Hills to climb
Need to know how to set up Jenkins and poudriere. Both technologies are very well documented online, and both have friendly communities where questions can be asked.
I am not opposed to writing such documentation specifically for this use case, but my time is limited, yet, I will welcome gentle nudges to produce a howto or video.
** Infrastructure Model
Quite simple actually. You'll set up a Jenkins master on any operating system, and a FreeBSD Jenkins agent running poudriere.
** Requirements
1. [[https://www.jenkins.io/][Jenkins]] server set up and ready to roll.
   This can be installed on an entirely different OS
   #+begin_src shell
    # On FreeBSD or in a FreeBSD jail.
    pkg install jenkins-lts
   #+end_src
2. [[https://freebsd.orf][FreeBSD]] with poudriere installed
   #+begin_src shell
    # On FreeBSD or in a FreeBSD jail.
    pkg install poudriere
   #+end_src
   Setting up and configuring Jenkins is left to you, but there are tons of online documentation to do so.
